/* When variables can be accessed before their declaration this happens because of Hoisting 
-- (?) So what hosting actually means ?
-- (+) Hoisting refers to the process of moving declarations to the --> "top" of their scope before code execution.

-- (+) IMPORTANT : [let] and [const] didn't support Hoisting but [var] does                                                 */
